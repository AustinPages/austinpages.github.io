      <h2>About Our Town</h2>
      <p>
        Nestled in the scenic countryside northwest of Auckland, <strong>Kumeu</strong> is a vibrant rural township known for its rolling vineyards, fresh produce, and tight-knit community spirit.
        With a population that blends farming families, artisans, and newcomers seeking a relaxed lifestyle, Kumeu continues to grow while keeping its country charm intact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The area is surrounded by fertile farmland, small orchards, and award-winning wineries. On weekends, the township comes alive with markets, horse shows, car rallies, and music in the park.
        Whether you’re visiting for a wine tasting, a day trip to Muriwai Beach, or moving here for good, Kumeu offers an authentic slice of New Zealand country life.

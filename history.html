      <h2>Early Settlement</h2>
      <p>
        Before European arrival, the Kumeu district was part of the traditional lands of the <em>Te Kawerau ā Maki</em> iwi.
        The fertile soils, rivers, and forests provided food and shelter for generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the mid-1800s, European settlers established small farms and timber operations. The name “Kumeu” is derived from a Māori word meaning “to draw together” — fitting for a town built around cooperation and community.

      <h2>The Railway Era</h2>
      <p>
        The arrival of the North Auckland railway line in the late 1800s transformed Kumeu into a trading hub for dairy and horticulture.
        A small station was built near what is now State Highway 16, and soon shops, a post office, and schools followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kumeu’s connection to Auckland allowed local produce to reach city markets and encouraged the establishment of vineyards — an industry that still defines the area today.

      <h2>Modern Kumeu</h2>
      <p>
        Through the 20th century, Kumeu remained a farming town, but by the 1990s, urban growth from Auckland began to reach the area.
        Today, Kumeu balances its agricultural heritage with small-town charm and modern living.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Kumeu Showgrounds continue to host one of New Zealand’s largest annual A&P shows, while new cafés, breweries, and artisan stores attract visitors from across the region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our community remains proud of its roots and is dedicated to protecting the open landscapes and friendly atmosphere that make Kumeu unique.
